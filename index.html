        My first favorite movie is spiderman far from home. the reason why is because
        tom holland's spiderman is relatable in that movie for me. he shows how he is 
        still a kid in highschool and how his school life and hero life are both hard
        to handle at the same time. overall this rating is a 10 out of 10.
